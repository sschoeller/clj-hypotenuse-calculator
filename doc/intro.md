# Introduction to sschoellerstem.pythagorean

This Clojure project utilizes the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
The code was written with the aid of the Counterclockwise plugin.

# Future direction

I hope to add exception-handling code and formalize the unit tests (currently a template) as I learn more about Clojure.
